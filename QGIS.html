        <h1 class="my-4">Improving land surface phenology retrievals for arid and semi-arid ecosystems
        </h1>
        <p>
            MCD12Q2 represents a significant data product sourced from the Terra and Aqua combined Moderate Resolution
            Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). It has been developed to offer a global depiction of land surface
            phenology metrics
            at yearly intervals. The most recent iteration, MCD12Q2 Version 6.1, presents data from 2001 to 2021. The
            data
            product is developed from the processing of time-series comprising the two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index
            (EVI2),
            which is derived from MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function-Adjusted Reflectance
            (NBAR).
            It has been designed to identify vegetation phenology metrics at 500-meter spatial resolution, including up
            to two
            observed growing cycles per year.

            <br>
            <br>

            Despite its global coverage, the MCD12Q2 product has certain limitations, as it does provide sufficient
            information
            for dryland ecosystems. Specifically, MCD12Q2 was only available for two years out of an eight-year
            observation period
            for a particular site where ground measurements were available. Through an analysis of ground measurements
            taken from
            the same location, it was clear that vegetation and photosynthesis were taking place at the same site where
            MCD12Q2
            failed to produce any data.
            <br>
            <br>

            This failure to produce data was not attributable to the lack of vegetation. Rather, MCD12Q2 employs a
            conservative approach
            in measuring phenological metrics, whereby a threshold of 0.1 is set for the seasonal amplitude (i.e., the
            difference between EVI max
            and EVI min values). Consequently, when the EVI's amplitude falls below this threshold, MCD12Q2 generates no
            data
            to avoid capturing random noise. Unfortunately, this approach results in a lack of data from regions with
            low
            vegetation
            index amplitude, such as drylands.

            <br>

        <p><strong>Research Question</strong> Can the detection of vegetation phenology in arid regions be improved by
            customizing
            the current global threshold of 0.1 to a more regionally appropriate value?

        <p>The present study is focused on six arid regions located within the United States, carefully selected
            due to the availability of ground-based measurements of photosynthesis. The primary data sources
            employed in this project are the MODIS MYD13A1 product, which provide EVI metrics, and flux measurements
            for photosynthesis. These data sources will be used for the purpose of validating the study's findings.

        <p> In this study, the MCD12Q2 approach is being largely followed for data preprocessing, which includes the
            elimination of errors and the application of a penalizing cubic smoothing spline to the time series.
            phenometrics are being defined in a similar way as MCD12Q2. However, there are three notable differences in
            the approach. Two of these differences are minor, but the most significant difference is the application of
            pixel-wise seasonal amplitude restrictions to capture a wider range of growing seasons with varying
            amplitudes. This approach differs from MCD12Q2's use of the same amplitude restriction for all pixels. These
            differences are outlined in the table and will be crucial in obtaining accurate results for this study.

        <p>The results of the preliminary analysis for phenometrics using a new regional pixel approach for the
            year 2007, where MCD12Q2 provided no data, are presented in this section. By implementing this novel
            approach, it was possible to determine the timing of the seven phenometrics (Figure 4). This demonstrates
            the effectiveness of the regional pixel approach in identifying phenological metrics in areas where
            traditional approaches may not provide sufficient data. Further research is needed to validate these results
            and extent the approach to other regions and time periods.

                seven phenometrics (Greenup, Mid-greenup, maturity, peak, senescence, mid-greendown, and dormancy)

        <p>The next steps in this study involve verifying the accuracy of the phenometrics dates obtained through the
            new regional pixel approach. To achieve this, a comparison will be made between the dates retrieved and
            those obtained from flux sites. Despite this, initial observations suggest that the EVI values obtained
            through the new approach visually correspond well with those obtained from the flux sites, as demonstrated
            by the figure presented (Figure 5). Once the validation process is complete, the analysis will be extended
            to include drylands across the world, including regions where flux sites are not available. This expansion
            of the study will provide a more comprehensive understanding of phenometrics and their relationship with
            environmental factors in drylands globally.
