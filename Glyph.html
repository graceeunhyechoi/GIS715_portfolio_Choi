    <p> The lab uses data sources such as Natural Earth, World Happiness Report 2018, and Climate Weather Surface of
      Brazil.
      The lab objectives were to use the ArcGIS Charts to renderer to visualize
      the world happiness data parts-of-whole and multivariate data, perform basic data matching of geographic
      data fields, use Python to read GIS attribute tables, use proportional or graduated symbol maps and multiple
      layers
      to encode multiple attributes.

      <p> <strong>Figure 1</strong> illustrates maps of Europe which display bar and pie charts representing the factors
        influencing happiness in each country. These factors were normalized based on the population of each respective
        country. The variable of social support, defined as the national average of responses (o or 1) to the question
        "If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them,
        or not?" was found to be the highest influencing factor on happiness for most countries. GDP and healthy life
        followed as the next significant factors. In contrast, freedom, generosity, and the perspective of corruption
        were all similarly ranked at a comparable level, as observed across most countries.

        <p><strong>Figure 2</strong> displays a proportional symbol map of the Denver Zoo trees as a percentage of the
          total
          number of trees. The symbol used to represent the trees is color-coded in green. The map is centered on the
          location of the
          Denver Zoo, and a smaller map is provided to indicate the location of the zoo in the broader context of the
          US.
          The map provides a visual representation and density of trees within the zoo, allowing for easy comparison
          between
          different areas. </p>

        <p><strong>Figure 3</strong> portrays the geographic distribution of relative humidity, maximum
          temperature, and atmospheric pressure in Brazil. The circle symbols on the map represent the relative
          humidity levels, where smaller circles denote lower relative humidity. It is noteworthy that all the locations
          included in the map have moderate relative humidity, and no specific area is more humid than the others. The
          colors on the map indicate the maximum temperature values, with most areas displaying maximum temperatures
          randing from 19 to 31 degress Celsius. Moreover, the figure highlights the location with the highest
          atmospheric pressure,
          represented by a blue-cyan color. By providing information about multiple climatic variables across Brazil,
          this
          figure can aid in understanding of the local weather patterns. </p>
