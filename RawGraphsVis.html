                <p> During the class session, we delved into the topic of infographics and covered a wide range of
                    topics
                    including the definition
                    and data visualzation, as well as the design process and guidelines for creating effective
                    infographics.
                    Furthermore, the class included
                    several examples of infographics and a demonstration of the resources available for creating them,
                    including
                    various desktop applications and
                    online tools. This section of figures showcases the importance of effective design in creating clear
                    and visually
                    appealing maps.

                    <p> <strong>Figure 1</strong> contains layers of roads, trails, water bodies, and airports. The map
                        includes
                        interstates, a secondary highway layer that
                        depicts main highways, and a local connecting road layer. The layer's symbology, such as color,
                        was chosen
                        to create visual contrast and complementarity between each other. The controlled-access highway
                        layer
                        was represented by thick,
                        red lines, the secondary highway layer by thin brow lines. This color and line
                        choice helps distinguish between the different layers on the map while also keeping the overall
                        design
                        visually harmonious. It is the result of experimenting with colors and automated symbology
                        setting for
                        lines, points, and
                        polygons.

                    <p><strong>Figure 2</strong> shows a map with color harmony and contrast. We modified Figure 1 to
                        use colors
                        that are highly distinguishable from each other, striving to overdo the contrast.
                        We were able to learn the
                        importance of color contrast in creating effective maps, as well as gain hands-on experience
                        with
                        modifying code to achieve specific map styles. The map also shows the layers of
                        different water bodies. The map includes lake/pond, reservoir. Each water body type was
                        represented by
                        different colors.</p>

                        The goal is to use colors that complement each other to achieve a visually pleasing result while

                        highlighting
